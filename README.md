Solace Online is an Online Streaming service provider and Platform
that offers a wide variety of content (movies, web shows, etc.) for its
subscribers. The Streaming Company wants to determine the driver
variables for first-day content viewership so that they can take
necessary measures to improve the viewership of the content on their
platform. Some of the reasons for the decline in viewership of content
would be the decline in the number of people coming to the platform,
decreased marketing spend, content timing clashes, weekends and
holidays, etc
